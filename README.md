# Recommendations-with-IBM
For this project I analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. 

My project is divided into the following tasks

I. Exploratory Data Analysis

II. Rank Based Recommendations

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

IV. Matrix Factorization
